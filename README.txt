Chess, Drupal, NodeJS
=====================

This is an experimental chess application.  The purpose is to
demonstrate the integration of a more "complex" node application
to the Drupal environment.

You will of course need the "nodejs integration module" and 
follow the installation and configuration guidelines there.

Be sure that the server config has the dchess.server.js lodaed as
an extension.  Also you will need to set clientsCanWriteToClients to true.
