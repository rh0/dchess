Chess, Drupal, NodeJS
=====================

This is an experimental chess application.  The purpose is to
demonstrate the integration of a more "complex" node application
to the Drupal environment.

You will of course need the "nodejs integration module" and 
follow the installation and configuration guidelines there.
